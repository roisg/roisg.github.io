Five months ago, after almost nine years working as CTO at Mobbeel, I decided to leave the company I founded with another four friends. It was a hard decision but I felt it as the right one. For several reasons I needed a change and that was the right moment to do it, with the company in a good position and with great people able to assume my responsabilities.

I decided to get some time off to just relax, enjoy the free time and feel again how it is the life outside a tech startup. It was a great time, being able to live slowly, to walk, meditate, get back to sports and also to have more time for friends and family. I also spent some time learning a bit of Swift, Kotlin and React Native, but just a few hours each to learn the basics.

On June I decided to start taking a look at the job market, to have an idea of what's out there for a developer with my profile. The only think I knew was that I needed a job with real flexibility, as I have got used to it last years and going back to a fixed schedule would have been hard. After some interesting interviews, it was clear to me that the best opportunities would be working as a freelance for international companies.

For some personal reasons I decided to start working only part-time as I wasn't able to commit to a full-time job. A month ago I found a company that gave me that opportunity, letting me work as much as I could and want every week, with my own schedule and in a really cool project. Besides, for me it was a challenge: I've been an iOS developer for 9 years but always working with Objective C; their code is 100% Swift -even the backend-, so I will be learning quickly and from great developers, so let's get the party started!
