# [Starting over]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/2018-07-17-starting-over.markdown %})

Five months ago, after almost nine years working as CTO at Mobbeel, I decided to leave the company I founded with four friends. It was a hard decision but I felt it was the right one. For several reasons I needed a change and that was the right moment to do it, with the company in a good position and with great people ready to take on my responsabilities.

I decided to get some time off just to relax, enjoy my free time and feel again how life is outside a tech startup. It was a great time, being able to live slowly, walk, meditate, hit the gym and also to have more time for friends and family. I also spent some time learning a bit of Swift, Kotlin and React Native, just to learn the basics, as I really need a break time.

On June I decided to start taking a look at the job market, to have an idea of what's out there for a developer with my profile. The only thing I knew for sure was that I needed a job with flexible hours. That is the way I’ve worked last years and going back to a fixed schedule would have been hard. After some interesting interviews, it was clear to me that the best opportunities would be working as a freelance for international companies.

I wanted to undertake some projects I had put off for too long because I couldn’t find the time so I didn’t want to commit to a full-time job. A month ago, I found a company that gave me that opportunity, letting me work as much as I could and want every week, with my own schedule and in a really cool project. Besides, for me it was a challenge: I've been an iOS developer for 9 years but always working with Objective C; their code is 100% Swift -even the backend-, so I am learning quickly and from awesome developers.

I'm back, so let's get the party started!
